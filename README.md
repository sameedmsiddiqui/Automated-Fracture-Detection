# Automated-Fracture-Detection
Project to automatically detect and identify fractures in X-rays - coded in C

NOTE: This program was built specifically for the TI LCDK c6748 DSP chip. Due to some quirks in this chip, as many variables as possible had to be declared in a global scope, and the code itself could not be split into multiple .c files.
